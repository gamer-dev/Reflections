1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

-->
    A repository is a hidden folder, a black box, from where git does its magic! When we initialize a repository,
	git creates an empty directory in the directory which we are currrently in. We need to do it, as it will
	keep track of the files we wish to commit, and enable Version Control by storing the metadata of the various
	versions of the file.
	
2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

-->
	The working area is the place where we work on our files, store them. And the staging area is the place where we store the changes 
	that occured on our files. It is the middle ground between working directory and the repository. It is the place that lets us keep
	only those files in our working directory, that need to be commited. The value it offers is that it acts as a necessary buffer 
	to keep files that need to be commited, tracked by git. We can also remove the files that do not need to be commited, so it
	also offers some safety measures, if we accidentally choose the wrong file to be commited.
	
3)  How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

-->
	By adding one file to the staging area per one logical change we have made to that file; and not adding other files
	to the stage, we can make sure that we have one commit per logical change. I.e, make one logical change in one file >
	add to stage > commit. This is the process to acheive that!
	
4)	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

-->
	Whenever we would like to work on an additional or an experimental feature in our software, we can use 
	the branch to do so, to not mess up the main files and also to be simultaneously work on both of the features of the 
	software. Thus, by creating a seperate entity to do different work(s) on it, branches make the project more
	organised and thus help to maintain and organize our history. 
	Also, we have the abiity to merge the branches into our main/master, so that we can easily add any changes of the branch
	successfully. 
	Thus, by creating a seperate thread to do our work in, and later on combine them if needed, Branches in git
	help to organize our history in a clean and a simple manner, which wouldn't have been acheiveable if we had kept
	using the checkout option in git.
