1)  When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> 
    Because creating a remote repository will: 
    
    i)  Serve as a Backup when and if my local files are deleted or they become corrupt.
    ii) Share my (Open Source) code and docs with the rest of the world.
	ii) Let me check out my work, from anywhere and any device, even if I don't have my machine with me.
