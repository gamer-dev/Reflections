1)  When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

--> 
    Because creating a remote repository will: 
    
    i)  Serve as a Backup when and if my local files are deleted or they become corrupt.
    ii) Share my (Open Source) code and docs with the rest of the world.
	ii) Let me check out my work, from anywhere and any device, even if I don't have my machine with me.

2)  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
	with your remote repository?

-->
	Because this approach gives me more control over what I would like to work on in my local machine.
